## JIRA PROJECT
[JIRA AGILE CV PROJECT](https://camilaqa.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CV/boards/1)
This project is using JIRA tool for project management and defect traking following agile methodology SCRUM with 2 weeks´s SPRINTS.

## DEMO VIDEO
This project includes a Demo Video of each functionallity developed.
* [DEMO VIDEOS](/demo-videos/)
## TEST STRATEGY
This project adopts BDD Methodology for testing.

1. Functional test scenarios are defined for each user story before development using the Gherkin language, facilitated by the Test Management Tool Zephyr Scale for Jira.

2. After every development iteration, a Static Test is performed using the SONARQUBE tool to ensure code quality.

3. Functional test scenarios are executed manually on both Desktop and Mobile platforms for each user story. Any encountered bugs are promptly logged on JIRA and linked to the respective user story and test scenario. Comprehensive test results are meticulously documented using Zephyr Scale.

4. At the conclusion of each Sprint, regression test scenarios are manually executed on both Desktop and Mobile platforms. The outcomes of these tests are  recorded using Zephyr Scale.

5. Upon completion of each Sprint, a new release version is crafted, encompassing:

* Successfully completed user stories.
* Detailed reports of functional test results and bug incidents.
* Regression test outcomes.
